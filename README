This project was for a first year university assignment.

It depends upon the serial comms libraries being installed, which are OS dependent.
The basic brief for the project was to implement a basic messaging protocol and
handle login and logout of users to a chat client. Messages can be sent between
users and a list of logged in users is recorded by each client.

Each client must forward messages not intended for that client, and they must
send ACK and NACK messages as appropriate. Messages not received are retransmitted.
And when no ACK is received by a sender then after a timeout retransmission is attempted.
